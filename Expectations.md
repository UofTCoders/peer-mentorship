## Peer Mentorship Expectations

We expect mentors and mentees to largely set their own terms
with regards to meeting frequency, forms of communication, and so on
based on what works for both parties and their respective needs/schedules.

However, we still expect that:

- Mentors and mentees contact one another and set terms **prior to the second co-working/intro session at the latest**.
- Mentors and mentees are both fully aware of and fully agree to the conditions set between them.
- All involved parties involved abide by the [Code of Conduct][conduct], both during UofT Coders events and in their own within-group communications. 
- Mentors and mentees attend at least one co-working session during the term.

We also encourage that:

- Mentees give a short presentation on their progress during the final co-working session at the end of the term.
- Mentees submit a response to our feedback form at the end of the term.
