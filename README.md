# UofT Coders Peer Mentorship - Spring 2022

Welcome! This repository contains information about UofT Coders Peer Mentorship 
program for both mentors and mentees.

## Resources

Like with our [regular events](https://github.com/UofTCoders/studyGroup/blob/gh-pages/codeOfConduct.md), 
all participants are required to conform to a Code of Conduct. Please see `CONDUCT.md` for more details.

We've laid out basic mentor/mentee expectations in `Expectations.md`. Mentors and mentees are of course welcome
and encouraged to expand upon these expectations to better suit their own needs and schedules.
